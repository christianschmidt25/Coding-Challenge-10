# Coding-Challenge-10
This is Coding Challenge 10, where I will create a simple e-commerce product management system that dynamically updates product details based on user interaction. This challenge will test my ability to handle events using JavaScript and demonstrate how separating HTML and JavaScript files can lead to better code organization and modularity.
